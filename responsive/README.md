# Aspects correctly implemented:
# 1. Figured out media query 
# 2. Understood how CSS sprites worked and implemented it

# Did not collaborate or discuss with anyone
# Although google was a big help. A couple of links I used apart from the ones provided:
# https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_background-position_pixel
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS
# https://css-tricks.com/positioning-offset-background-images/
# http://cssmediaqueries.com/overview.html

# Approx duration: 3hrs
