# Aspects I implemented successfully:
1. Generated map, fit to screen
2. Managed to calculate current position and create marker
3. Made code a little more efficient by remaking an array of objects
4. Managed to locate nearest train station, calculate distance, and display information
5. Managed to draw polyline linking me to nearest train station

# Challenges and Aspects I did not implement successfully:
Had problems with the MBTA schedules - they would refuse to load on the popup window, and I don't know why

# Resources:
1. Piazza
2. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/infowindow-simple

# Approximate duration spent: 10hrs (yeah I struggled with this one again)
