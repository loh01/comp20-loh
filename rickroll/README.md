# Aspects successfully implemented:
1. Managed to implement styling
2. Managed to used events to keep track of the timing of the video

# Challenges:
1. Without the double rainbow example, I would not have been able to figure out a way to proceed
2. For some reason, initially even though my code checked out and everything seemed right, the video was still somehow not annotated. Fiddled with the parentheses, and only then it seemed to work. Why do the parenthese rules not seem to be the same as C++?
3. Having to slowly sit through all 3.32mins of Rick

# Resources:
1. Mozila links provided 
2. Double Rainbow example provided
3. Reached out to Yash (who previously took COMP20) to check if I'm on the right track

# Approximate duration spent: 3 hours
